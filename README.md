# EvaluMate- IDC-Hackathon 2021
This project was written as part of IDC's 2021 Hackathon.

The challenge was to determine the value of an apartment's contents without the assistance of a surveyor or appraiser.

Within 24 hours, our team created a mobile app that scans items by picture and evaluates their worth without the intervention of an appraiser.

The app was developed in Flutter using Firebase.
Python is used on the server side.
